# Interview Questions

## Event Loop

```
How do Event loops work?
Call Stack:
JavaScript uses a call stack to keep track of the currently executing function (where the program is in its execution).
Callback Queue:
Asynchronous operations, such as I/O operations or timers, are handled by the browser or Node.js runtime. When these operations are complete, corresponding functions (callbacks) are placed in the callback queue.
Event Loop:
The event loop continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue. If the call stack is empty, it takes the first function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.
Execution:
The function on top of the call stack is executed. If this function contains asynchronous code, it might initiate further asynchronous operations.
Callback Execution:
When an asynchronous operation is complete, its callback is placed in the callback queue.
Repeat:
The event loop continues this process, ensuring that the call stack is always empty before taking the next function from the callback queue.
Example: In this example, a JavaScript script demonstrates synchronous blocking behavior. It starts by logging “Before delay,” then uses a function delayBySeconds to create a delay of 5 seconds using a busy-wait loop. The script then logs “After delay” after the 5-second delay completes.
```

## Obsrevables vs Promises

```Promises are suitable for single asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API. Observables are ideal for handling streams of data, such as user input, WebSocket events, or HTTP responses, where multiple values might be emitted over time.
